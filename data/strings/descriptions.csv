FM_Rotation,SHIP,"One of the first frigates in the Gensoukyou Program, a design modelled based on the Tempest class, but more oriented towards fleet support.

Attempting to meet or even surpass Tempest in all performance, (which it did in fact do in terms of energy systems) at the cost having low PD capability, often relying on upgraded shields to avoid missile threats when being alone.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,

FM_Firefly,SHIP,"A multi-purpose frigate with seemingly insufficient firepower but actually quite very good, its one of the highest exported one from Gensoukyou Manufacturing which has varying degrees of combat capability in different variant of loadouts.

Although a relatively low-cost frigate, Hotaru primary role is to support larger ships, providing close support with missiles and beam weapons. However, Gensoukyou Manufacturing's investigations suggest that a ""swarm"" of Hotaru could be an option in smaller battles.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,

FM_Rabbit,SHIP,"Although the energy systems and shields are of a conventional standard, the ability to spread light spaces mines has been well received.

It is more flexible in terms of weapon systems than the usual Wolf class, and with a light spaces mine field can cause considerable problems for smaller fleets.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Parasol,SHIP,"An expensive and advanced armed cargo ship, with a performing to military frigate standards, less well known in smuggling circles than the older Hounds and Cerberus due its low production and high cost.

But there was still a place for this overpowered design: for small explorer who could not afford a large exploration vessel, the Kogasa class was their nanny.

The highly automated operating system requires only a small crew to navigate, with plenty of fuel and cargo space, a mini flight deck, adequate armament, and excellent manueverability ...... She is more reliable than any armed civilian ship in the treacherous Outers Persean Sector.

FM_Egret,SHIP,"A High-Speed Carrier with a Built-in Amanojyaku Ummanned Fighter and Two Standard Hangars thats compatible with most conventional LPCs, in addition to that its also have a special shipsystem to accelerate fighter squadrons enough to increase their strike intensity.

Despite her excellent performance, her peculiar ship systems make her no more popular than the Heron class ----- although fighter pilots have speak highly of this ship that has ensured their safety to a great extent.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,

FM_Puppeteer,SHIP,"Lighter and faster, this Light Carrier have the ability to reduce the strength of an opponent's resistance.

One of the mainstays of small fleets, although not as violent as other, it came with simple a ship system as other light carriers in the persean sector, the ability to paralyze defences are effective for captains who are looking for a quick victory and is often used as a secondary carrier for larger fleets.

However, captains commanding such ships are initially told not to probe deeply into her built-in modules, but the reasons for this are not yet clear.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,

FM_Aya,SHIP,"A high-speed destroyer with a tabloid level of maneuverability and a relatively amazing level of protection.

Despite its relatively small appearance and its deranged energy system, an advanced shield generators is installed with an addition of experimental phasing system underneath its fragile light armor plate, this ship was frequently often seen in one of the fast strike force, relying on advanced ship systems to surprise its opponents.

Although the firepower seems weak and lacking in PD, the built-in Karasu drones provide a reasonably reliable active protection in most cases.

FM_Miko,SHIP,"Travelling outside the boundaries and journeying through the stars, 'Miko' , one of the symbols of Gensoukyou Manufacturing is a perfect illustration of its unique space tactics doctrine.

With its special missile arrays integrated into the hull, Miko has far more firepower than any other ship in its class, while its special ship systems reflect Gensoukyou Manufacturing's leadership in space operations technology and provide the ship with great manueverability.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Witch,SHIP,"Designed in mind for the ultimate firepower, she was so vulnerable and so deadly that she was considered a Gensoukyou-made version of the Super Mudskipper MK2.

The ship's most distinctive feature is the final version of the Spark series of beam weapons --- Master Spark, a fearsome weapon with a short but powerful range, and auxiliary thrusters for close range combat.

Despite having decent shields, adequate flux systems and manueverability, the ship is still prone to dying when the missiles run out, poor thing...

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Konpaku,SHIP,"While the ship looks big, its essentially still a Light Cruiser that have the ability to vaporise any nearby ship within range while also being somewhat effective to hinder larger ships.

However, the ship is only adequately equipped for self-protection againts fighter squadrons, while in large battles it'll generally acts as a strike force or simultaneously with others dedicated carrier.

As to why the ship has become less 'light', rumour has it that some unknown collaborative engineering project is involved.

An oddly shaped Hinotama attack drone are built-in, presumably to provide some firepower...

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Satori,SHIP,"A less harmonious but relatively reliable and professional support ship with long-range energy weapons and electronic warfare(?) capabilities. The ability to overwhelm opponents with long-range energy weapons and electronic warfare (?) capabilities.

Even Gensoukyou Manufacture's own researcher were unable to decipher its built-in modules, and blueprints for this ship were still widely used, becoming a nightmare for even the Luddic fleet...

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Yagokoro,SHIP,"A highly effective multi-purpose anchor ship with the ability to deliver long-range fighter groups as well as striking the enemy immediately.

Even if a high-threat target are closing in vicinity, it can use a special teleportation system called ""Endless Gallery"" to get itself temporarily out of range of the enemy ship, but if the shields fail or the fighters are destroyed and slow to be replaced, it'll be surrounded.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Miracle,SHIP,"A high-end heavy cruiser equipped with powerful frontal firepower that relied on special ship system to complement its defensive capabilities.

Like most Gensoukyou-made ships, the Kiseki class has a unique ship system with a strong link to the inner side of the boundary, and this ability to deflect a certain degree of projectiles has proved invaluable.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Byakuren,SHIP,"A large combat ship with an excellent shield system and light armor similar to that of the Paragon class, it is also one of the few ships Gensoukyou have built to perform so well without relying on dedicated carrier in combat.

It is slightly more manueverable than most conventional battleships, and have a reliable ship system that enhances its defensive capabilities while also increasing its speed. (But it seems to be more effective as a deterrent in real combat?)

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Nightbird,SHIP,"This Ships are used to support the main fleet and to annihilate smaller ships, though it does not have the ability to hinder opponents to some degree.

Relying on the high end electronic systems within the hull, the Yasuzume is extremely efficient at gaining an electronic warfare advantage, and her built in ship systems allow her to easily deal with small targets or retreat quickly.

The only downside is perhaps the weaker protection...

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Loupgarou,SHIP,"A versatile destroyer design that is robust and reliable and capable of fighting any enemy.

It was planned to carry medium missile weapons and large energy weapons, but for various reasons this was abandoned in favour of a small, versatile armament.

Although not as manueverable as conventional ships, they are still able to make short bursts to overwhelm enemy ships with the aid of ship systems.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Hearn,SHIP,"A very unusual cruiser design with ship systems and built-in modules that significantly enhance the operational efficiency of Space Superiority Fighters, while also having enough firepower to fight directly itself.

It Has the ability to manipulate the boundary for certain minimal degrees, but its enough to allow it to transport its own fighter to quickly harass opponents. It should be noted that the bombers cannot be teleported due to the system constraints.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.

In addition, there are indications that the ship is contaminated with more complex modalities, as evidenced by her alias ""Realm Scholar""...",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Rumia,SHIP,"A Phase Frigates designed specificly to counter conventional 'Shade' Class that were slightly stronger than the competitor in actual combat performance. However, due to the lack of emphasis for Phased Ships by Gensoukyou Manufacturing... this ship are rarely seens.

Despite the fact that its performance are quite similar to that of a conventional phase frigates, Gensoukyou Manufacturing have miniaturized a advanced phasing system which has attracted wide interest from ship researcher. a unreliable sources suggest that this also most likely are closely linked to the 'civilization' within the inner side of the boundaries.

an Early models of it exist, just like the shade class... it was equipped with EMP Generator to strike and paralyze the target, but it were replaced with more dazzling ""Moonlight"" System due to its poor performance in combat, which gave her an significant advantages againts ships with powerfull defense.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Reisen,SHIP,"A Design Focused on assault and harassment, this destroyers unique systems give her another possibility, despite being relatively weak in frontal combat.

Originally designed to replace the Medusa class destroyers that Gensoukyou Manufacturing had equipped prior to Independence, applying a great deal of Innerside Boundary technology, the type seemed to have drifted off course by the time the engineers came around ......

Despite its modest performance, the maddening red phantom still struck fear into the hearts of the hostile forces around Gensoukyou.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Baize,SHIP,"Synonymous with history and knowledge, and named after an ancient beast of prey, the Baize is arguably the most versatile civilian ship in the Gensoukyou Manufacture Fleet.

The protective hull of the bow is equipped with advanced sensors and exploration equipment using the technology of the civilisation within the inner side of the boundaries to search for forgotten artifacts from a by gone Domain Era. On either side of the hull are several large multi-purpose compartments that allow the ship to accommodate both antimatter fuel and cargo.

Most importantly, the combination of a standard flight deck and reserve deployment system makes the Baize more than capable of escort carrier duties, providing all-round support for a small technical survey fleet, although when a real enemy comes to kill, the fragile armor alone will probably be of little use ......

For worlds that were once bountiful and full of life but have now seen civilization collapse, the appearance of a Baize is often a harbinger of a return to civilization and order.

Like other Gensoukyou-made ships, it seems to have suffered from some modular capability.",,,,
,,,,,,
FM_Bazhiwu,SHIP,"An Exceptional Strike Ships with large energy weapon slots mounted on the hull and equipped with perfectly adequate dissipation capability and decent protection, are in a sense are considerably powerful frigates.

In Addition to the large energy weapons is The Reactor Meltdown System. Despite the risks involved, this system boosts the power output of the weapons over a relatively long period of time, further enhancing the ship's firepower.

The only unfortunate thing is that the weapon calibration AI of Yatagarasu has suffered somewhat due to over-reaching on the energy system, but it seems harmless enough for a frigate that often fights at close range...
