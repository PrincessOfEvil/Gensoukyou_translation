		"FantasyAliceMod_DAE_0": "A generic system based on remote control and AI flight control initially designed to reduce carrier pilot losses, but the project was cut to save just the built-in for the Alice class. \n\nThe psychic energy-based time-streaming system largely improves the combat efficiency of the ship's aircraft when approaching the carrier. However, as with common time-streaming devices in the astral domain, the psychic damage to the carrier members still exists. \n \n By allowing pilots to operate warplanes remotely from within the carrier through psychic devices does reduce combat losses. But according to very unreliable gossip, in order to use this system, the pilot's brain will be semi-permanently linked directly to the ship's AI, resulting in [data deletion].",
